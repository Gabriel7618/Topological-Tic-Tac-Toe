# Topological-Tic-Tac-Toe

**Requires:** Pygame 3

I have created a game (with menu, game and game history screens) that allows users to play tic-tac-toe in different formats. They will be able to vary the topology of the grid, which they are playing on, (e.g., plane, cylinder, mobius strip, torus, klein bottle, projective plane), the size of the grid and length of the line needed to win. Also, they will be able to: play against a computer or another user; undo their moves and possibly load their previous games from a database.

See the Report.docx for a more comprehensive overview.
